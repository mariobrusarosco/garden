# 001: Upgrade to Next.js 15

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2024-07-31

## Context and Problem Statement

The project is currently running on Next.js v14.2.3. The official stable release of Next.js is now v15. To leverage the latest features, performance enhancements, and security updates, and to avoid accumulating significant technical debt, we need to upgrade our core framework. Staying on an older version makes future upgrades more difficult and prevents us from using modern best practices.

## Decision Drivers

- **Access to New Features**: Next.js 15 introduces features like the experimental React Compiler, more granular caching control, and other improvements.
- **Performance**: Each new version of Next.js typically includes performance optimizations that will benefit the application's speed and user experience.
- **Security**: Upgrading ensures we have the latest security patches from the Next.js team.
- **Maintainability**: Staying current with major dependencies reduces the complexity of future upgrades.

## Considered Options

1.  **Upgrade to Next.js 15**: A direct upgrade to the latest stable version.
2.  **Remain on Next.js 14**: Postpone the upgrade, accepting the risk of technical debt and missing out on new features.

## Decision

We have decided to proceed with **Option 1** and upgrade the project to Next.js 15.

This decision is based on the clear benefits of improved performance, access to modern features, and long-term project maintainability. The migration path is well-documented by the Next.js team, and we have formulated a clear plan to address the breaking changes.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The application will be up-to-date with the latest web development standards pushed by Vercel and the React team.
- Developers will be able to use new APIs and features, improving productivity and code quality.
- The project will see immediate performance and security benefits.

### Negative

- The upgrade requires developer time for implementation and thorough testing.
- The breaking change in `fetch` caching behavior requires a careful audit of our data-fetching logic to ensure the application continues to function as expected.

### Risks

- Unforeseen issues may arise during the upgrade that are not covered in the official documentation, requiring additional debugging.
- The new default caching behavior could be implemented incorrectly, leading to performance degradation or stale data if not carefully managed.

## Migration Plan

The detailed migration steps are documented in our planning document:
