## Creating a project

Second, I need you to follow a couple of behaviors:

1. Don't ask a lot of permissions to me, only the most important ones.
2. You can ask me permissions when running commands, but I would love you to auto wait for the command output and keep working on it
3. Don't rush yourself to answer me. I need you to be slow than make me spend time in solutions that you're not confident with. Keep applying your solutions untll the code is working. Don't assume you are correct or that you solved my issue, unless you're really confident about it
4. Before moving to the next step I need you to write a guide about everything you did, creating .md files on the ROOT level of the project. Each .md must have two main secitions: A) Rationale (this is the space you explain the rationale to choose that approach, the chosen tools, etc. B) A guide to other engineers that will face the project for the first time. Think of as a guidance/documentation for them.

ðŸš€ Startup MVP Action Plan
Stack Recommendation
Backend:
NestJS (TypeScript) - Highly scalable, great for rapid development
PostgreSQL - Reliable, flexible, great free tier options
Prisma - Type-safe ORM, excellent for rapid development
JWT Authentication - Simple, stateless auth
Frontend:
Next.js 14 (App Router) - Fast development, great SEO, excellent DX
TailwindCSS - Rapid UI development
shadcn/ui - Pre-built components, highly customizable
React Query - Data fetching/caching
Infrastructure/Services:
Vercel (Frontend) - Great free tier, easy deployment
Railway or Supabase (Database) - Good free tiers
GitHub - Version control, CI/CD
GitHub Actions - Automated testing/deployment
ðŸ“‹ Action Plan (Step by Step)
Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (Backend Focus)
âœ… Initialize project structure (monorepo setup)
â¬œ Setup PostgreSQL database
Choose hosting (Railway/Supabase)
Setup initial connection
â¬œ Create core backend structure
Setup NestJS with TypeScript
Configure Prisma
Setup initial schema
â¬œ Implement authentication system
User model
JWT implementation
Login/Register endpoints
â¬œ Create core API endpoints
CRUD operations
API documentation
â¬œ Setup automated testing
Unit tests
E2E tests
Phase 2: Frontend Development
â¬œ Setup Next.js application
Configure TypeScript
Setup TailwindCSS
Install key dependencies
â¬œ Create core UI components
Design system setup
Component library integration
â¬œ Implement authentication UI
Login page
Registration page
Protected routes
â¬œ Build core features UI
Main application pages
API integration
Error handling
Phase 3: DevOps & Deployment
â¬œ Setup CI/CD pipeline
GitHub Actions configuration
Automated testing
â¬œ Configure deployment
Vercel setup
Environment variables
Domain configuration
Phase 4: Testing & Launch Preparation
â¬œ Comprehensive testing
Integration testing
User acceptance testing
â¬œ Security audit
Dependency review
Security best practices
â¬œ Performance optimization
Load testing
Optimization fixes
Phase 5: Launch
â¬œ Production deployment
Final checks
Monitoring setup
â¬œ Post-launch monitoring
Error tracking
Analytics setup
ðŸ’° Cost Breakdown (Monthly Estimates)
Free Tier Services:
GitHub (Free for public repos)
Vercel (Hobby tier)
Railway/Supabase (Free tier initially)
Paid Services (When Needed):
Database Hosting: $5-50/month
Domain Name: ~$12/year
Error Tracking (Sentry): Free tier initially
CI/CD: Free with GitHub Actions
ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Considerations
Database:
Start with free tier
Easy upgrade path available
Horizontal scaling possible
Infrastructure:
Vercel handles scaling automatically
Easy migration path to other providers if needed
Architecture:
Modular design for easy feature addition/removal
API-first approach for flexibility
Type safety for maintainability
Current Status
âœ… Step 1 completed (Project structure initialized)
â¬œ Next up: Step 2 (Database setup)
Would you like to proceed with Step 2? I can help you set up the database and provide the necessary commands and configurations.
Remember: This plan is flexible and can be adjusted based on your specific needs or if we need to pivot during development. Each step is designed to build upon the previous one while maintaining the ability to modify or extend functionality easily.
