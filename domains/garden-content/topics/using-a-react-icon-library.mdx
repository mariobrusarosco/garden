# Using a React Icon Library

Modern React applications benefit from using dedicated icon libraries that provide scalable, customizable, and tree-shakeable icon components. Below are four excellent options evaluated for Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4 projects.

---

## Option 1: Lucide React

### The Library

Lucide React is a modern icon library that provides beautifully crafted icons as React components. It's a community-maintained fork of Feather Icons with expanded icon sets and ongoing active development.

**Usage Example:**

```tsx
import { Home, Settings, User } from 'lucide-react';

export const Navigation = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Home size={24} color="#000" strokeWidth={2} />
      <Settings size={24} className="text-blue-500" />
      <User size={24} />
    </nav>
  );
};
```

### Why It's a Fit for This Project Stack

export const Navigation = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <FaHome className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-700" />
      <MdSettings className="w-6 h-6 text-blue-500" />
      <HiUser className="w-6 h-6" />
    </nav>

**Usage Example:**

```tsx
import { HomeIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { CogIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/solid';

export const Navigation = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <HomeIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-500" />
      <CogIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-blue-500" />
    </nav>
  );
};
```

### Why It's a Fit for This Project Stack

## Recommendation Summary

| Library | Best For | Bundle Impact | Icon Count | Unique Advantage |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **Lucide React** | General use, performance-critical apps | Minimal (1-2KB per icon) | 1,000+ | Best tree-shaking, modern |
| **React Icons** | Projects needing multiple icon families | Medium (with tree-shaking) | 15,000+ | All-in-one solution |
| **Heroicons** | Tailwind CSS projects | Minimal | 300+ | Native Tailwind integration |
| **Phosphor Icons** | Design systems needing weight variants | Small-Medium | 1,200+ | 6 weight variants |

## Implementation Pattern

Regardless of which library you choose, follow this pattern for consistency:

```tsx
// Create an icon wrapper for centralized styling
import { Home } from 'lucide-react'; // or your chosen library

interface IconProps {
  size?: number;
  className?: string;
}

export const Icon = ({ Icon: IconComponent, size = 24, className }: IconProps & { Icon: any }) => {
  return <IconComponent size={size} className={cn('transition-colors', className)} />;
};

// Usage
<Icon Icon={Home} size={24} className="text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-500" />
```

This approach allows you to:
- Centralize icon styling and behavior
- Easily swap icon libraries if needed
- Apply consistent transitions and effects
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript
