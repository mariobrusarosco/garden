# Next.js Analytics

## Overview

Next.js provides two official packages for monitoring your application's performance and user behavior:

1. **@vercel/analytics** - User behavior tracking and custom events
2. **@vercel/speed-insights** - Real User Monitoring (RUM) for Core Web Vitals

Both tools work seamlessly on Vercel deployments with zero configuration, but can also be used with custom deployments.

## Installation

### Installing Both Packages

```bash
yarn add @vercel/analytics @vercel/speed-insights
```

### Installing Individually

```bash
# For analytics only
yarn add @vercel/analytics

# For speed insights only
yarn add @vercel/speed-insights
```

## Setup

### App Router Setup (Next.js 13+)

Add both components to your root layout file:

`app/layout.tsx`

```tsx
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  Place the components at the end of the `<body>` tag to ensure they don't
  block the rendering of your application.
</Callout>

### Pages Router Setup (Next.js 12 and below)

Add both components to your `_app.tsx` file:

`pages/_app.tsx`

```tsx
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <Analytics />
      <SpeedInsights />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Analytics Features

### Automatic Page View Tracking

The Analytics component automatically tracks:

- Page views across all routes
- User sessions
- Geographic data
- Device information
- Referrer sources

### Custom Event Tracking

Track custom user interactions:

```tsx
import { track } from "@vercel/analytics";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    track("button_clicked", {
      location: "header",
      label: "Sign Up",
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Sign Up</button>;
};
```

### Event Properties

You can attach custom properties to events:

```tsx
track("purchase", {
  value: 99.99,
  currency: "USD",
  item: "Premium Plan",
});
```

## Speed Insights Features

### Core Web Vitals Monitoring

Speed Insights automatically tracks:

1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** - Loading performance
2. **FID (First Input Delay)** - Interactivity
3. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** - Visual stability
4. **TTFB (Time to First Byte)** - Server response time

### Real User Monitoring

Unlike synthetic testing, Speed Insights collects data from real users:

- Device-specific performance metrics
- Geographic performance variations
- Network condition impact
- Browser-specific metrics

## Configuration

### Development Mode

By default, analytics are disabled in development. To enable:

```tsx
<Analytics mode="development" />
```

### Custom Endpoint (Self-Hosting)

For non-Vercel deployments, configure a custom endpoint:

```tsx
<Analytics
  beforeSend={(event) => {
    // Modify or filter events
    return event;
  }}
/>
```

Add environment variable:

```bash
VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logs during development:

```tsx
<Analytics debug={true} />
<SpeedInsights debug={true} />
```

## Enabling Analytics on Vercel Dashboard

After deploying your application with the Analytics and SpeedInsights components, you need to enable these features on Vercel:

### Step 1: Navigate to Analytics Tab

1. Go to your project on the Vercel dashboard
2. Click the **Analytics** tab in the navigation

### Step 2: Enable Web Analytics

You'll see an "Enable" button. Click it to open the configuration modal.

### Step 3: Choose Your Plan

**Web Analytics on Hobby** (Free):
- 50,000 events/month included
- 30 days viewable history
- No Custom Events
- Capped data ingestion

**Web Analytics on Pro** ($20/month):
- Higher limits for custom events and data retention

<Callout>
  For most personal projects and small applications, the Hobby plan is sufficient. You can always upgrade later if needed.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Enable Speed Insights

After enabling Analytics, you'll see a similar prompt for **Speed Insights** in the bottom right corner. Click **Enable** to activate it as well.

### Viewing Your Data

Once enabled:

1. **Analytics Tab** - View user behavior data:
   - Page views
   - Visitors
   - Top pages
   - Geographic distribution
   - Device and browser data

2. **Speed Insights Tab** - View performance metrics:
   - Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
   - Real user monitoring data
   - Performance trends over time

### Data Collection Timeline

- Initial data appears within **5-10 minutes** after enabling
- Full metrics populate as real users visit your site
- Historical trends build up over the 30-day retention period

## Best Practices

### 1. Privacy Considerations

Analytics respects user privacy:

- No cookies are used
- No personal data is collected
- GDPR compliant by default

### 2. Performance Impact

Both packages are designed to be lightweight:

- Analytics: ~1kb gzipped
- Speed Insights: ~2kb gzipped
- Loaded asynchronously after page load

### 3. Custom Events Strategy

<Callout>
  Track meaningful user interactions, not every click. Focus on conversion
  funnels, feature adoption, and business-critical actions.
</Callout>

### 4. Combining with Other Tools

Analytics and Speed Insights work alongside:

- Google Analytics
- Mixpanel
- PostHog
- Custom analytics solutions

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Loading

Load analytics only in production:

```tsx
{
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && (
    <>
      <Analytics />
      <SpeedInsights />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Route-Specific Tracking

Track specific route patterns:

```tsx
"use client";

import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import { track } from "@vercel/analytics";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const RouteTracker = () => {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (pathname.startsWith("/dashboard")) {
      track("dashboard_view", { path: pathname });
    }
  }, [pathname]);

  return null;
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Showing Data

1. Verify components are added to root layout
2. Check environment variables for custom deployments
3. Ensure project is deployed (doesn't work on localhost by default)
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for data to appear

### Speed Insights Missing Metrics

1. Ensure modern browser support (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+)
2. Check that HTTPS is enabled
3. Verify SpeedInsights component is properly imported

### Debug Mode Not Working

```tsx
// Enable debug to see console logs
<Analytics debug={process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"} />
```

## Migration from Other Analytics

### From Google Analytics

You can run both simultaneously:

```tsx
// Keep existing GA
<Script
  src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${GA_ID}`}
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>

// Add Vercel Analytics
<Analytics />
```

### From Custom Solutions

Use the `beforeSend` hook to bridge data:

```tsx
<Analytics
  beforeSend={(event) => {
    // Send to your custom endpoint
    yourCustomTracker.track(event);
    return event;
  }}
/>
```
