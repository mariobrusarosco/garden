# React Context

<Callout>
  A friend reminder. React Context is not a `State Maanger`. It's a way to pass
  data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at
  every level.

## Understanding Nested Contexts and Hierarchy

When you have nested contexts, the innermost context takes precedence over the outer context. This means that the innermost context will be used when a component consumes multiple contexts.

On the example below the ChildComponent doesn't have its own context, so it uses the context provided by the ParentComponent. So the value is `light`. If, we didn't have ParentComponent with a Context, only then, the Context's default value would be used: `light`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

const ParentComponent = () => {
  return (
    <themeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <ChildComponent />
    </themeContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = () => {
  const theme = React.useContext(themeContext);

  return <div>Theme is {theme}</div>;
};
```
