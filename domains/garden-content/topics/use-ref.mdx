# useRef

A hook that creates a value that is preserved across renders, but it doesn't trigger a re-render when it changes.

<Callout>
  This value is indeed mutable! We're changing it directly and it's ok!
</Callout>

## When to use?

One tip is to use it when we need a state that's not related to UI element of our component. For example, if this state doesn't change the color of a `<div>`, the text of a `<p>`... This state is important for our Component, but it's related to the Component's behavior, not Component's appearance.

Another tip is to use it when we need to access a DOM element directly. For example, if we need to focus on an input field, we can use `useRef` to get the reference of this input field.
