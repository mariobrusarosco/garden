# Context

When using AWS Services we'll eventually interact with SDK, Libs or CLI where we'll need to identify ouserlves.
So AWS can undertand which AWS User is consuming the services, if that user has the correct permissions, and so on.

## CLI

A common use for Front End App, ironically leaves the Front End domain: Continous Deployment.

We need to build and deploy a Front End App.
We might host assets (images, logs, etc) and serve them to users.

In this scenario we can use AWS CLI.

### For Deploys

We need to create a _User_. Users exist inside IAM section: Identity and Access Management

1. Give a name to the User

2. Time to add permissions. At this day, we're not familiar with granular level permissions - for our case we would only need
   S3 access and permissions. We'll deep dive on in later on. For now, let's set attach one Policy: _Adminstractor Access_.
   Then click Next.

3. Create the user

4. Creating access keys

- Click on Create access key
- Choose:
  Command Line Interface (CLI)
  You plan to use this access key to enable the AWS CLI to access your AWS account.

5. Write down the access key and access key id
