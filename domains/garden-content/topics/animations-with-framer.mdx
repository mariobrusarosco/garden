# Animations with Framer

## animate

`animate()` from `framer-motion` X `animate()` from `useAnimate()`

When we import `animate()` from `framer-motion`, all elements that iteract with it will be under its scope and will share it! So, be aware of side effects like the same animation being triggered for another element other than the one you expect

`animate()` from `useAnimate()` will be scoped to the component/hook where you've instantiated `useAnimate()`. It won't interfere with other elements

## SVG / Path

### animate() bugs

#### 1

When animating an SVG path, the `animate()` function will not animate the `pathLengh`. It will change its value abruptly.

```tsx
await animate("path", { pathLength: 0.5 }, { duration: 1 });
```

### Solution

We need to add an initial value:

## Transform

Framer Motion can animate transform props, but will clash with CSS transform rules applied to the element you're animating.

Let's say you're centralizing an element with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`. If you animate the `x` property, it will work, but when the animations ends, Framer will apply `transform: none` as _inline style_ therefore overriding the `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` appplied via any CSS Selector

### Solution

Remove the styles you've applied via CSS and apply them via Framer Motion.

## Animating Calculated values

We can use CSS `calc()` inside a string:

### Orchestration Bugs

### StaggerChildren Bugs

<Callout>
  `StaggerChildren` may fail when used with `whileHover` or `whileTap`
  properties. This is because the `whileHover` or `whileTap` properties are not
  considered as children of the parent element. This can lead to unexpected
  behavior.
</Callout>

## Animating SVGs

### Setting SVG attributes x Changing CSS classes

It' nice to keep in mind to not mix SVG attributes that will be animated with CSS classes that will be animated. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

_Example_

We have an SVG that will be animated on `hover`. We'll change its `fill`. We need to set `fill` in two places:

1. The default fill as an SVG attribute
2. The new fill that must be animated and appear on hover.

This is how it would get confused:

1. The default fill as an CSS class
2. The new fill that must be animated and appear on hover.

The result of this example is:

1. Framer will animate the fill from green to red.
2. But after the hover ends, it can't find any "fill" property to go back to! It doesnt' know that the CSS class 'fill-green' it's the responsible for applying the fill color.
3. In doubt, it will keep the fill color as red!
